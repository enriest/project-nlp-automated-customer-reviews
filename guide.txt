PROJECT NLP | AUTOMATED CUSTOMER REVIEWS - COMPLETE GUIDE

==============================================================================
OVERVIEW
==============================================================================

This guide walks you through the complete process of building an NLP model to 
automatically classify customer reviews as positive, negative, or neutral. You'll 
compare traditional ML approaches with modern Transformer-based solutions.

GOAL: Compare traditional ML solutions (NaiveBayes, SVM, RandomForest) vs Deep 
Learning (Transformers from HuggingFace) for review sentiment analysis.

==============================================================================
PHASE 1: PROJECT SETUP & DATA COLLECTION
==============================================================================

STEP 1: Environment Setup
- Set up Python environment with required libraries:
  * pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
  * scikit-learn
  * nltk or spacy
  * transformers, torch
  * plotly or tableau (for visualization)

STEP 2: Data Collection
- Download dataset from one of these sources:
  * Kaggle: Amazon customer reviews dataset
  * HuggingFace: amazon_us_reviews dataset
- Choose dataset size that fits your computing resources

STEP 3: Data Understanding
- Load the dataset and explore its structure
- Check columns: review text, ratings, product categories
- Examine data distribution and quality

STEP 4: Target Variable Creation
Transform ratings using this logic:
- Scores 1, 2, 3 → "Negative"
- Score 4 → "Neutral" 
- Score 5 → "Positive"

==============================================================================
PHASE 2: TRADITIONAL NLP & ML APPROACH
==============================================================================

STEP 5: Data Preprocessing (Traditional)

5.1 Data Cleaning
- Remove special characters, punctuation, unnecessary whitespace
- Convert text to lowercase
- Handle missing values

5.2 Tokenization and Lemmatization
- Tokenize text into individual words/tokens
- Apply lemmatization to reduce words to base form
- Remove stopwords

5.3 Vectorization
- Apply CountVectorizer or TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Create document-term matrix
- Consider n-grams (unigrams, bigrams)

STEP 6: Traditional Model Building

6.1 Train-Test Split
- Split data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80-20)
- Ensure balanced distribution of classes

6.2 Model Selection & Training
Test multiple algorithms:
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Random Forest
- Use cross-validation for model selection
- Apply grid search for hyperparameter tuning

STEP 7: Traditional Model Evaluation

7.1 Calculate Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-score for each class
- Confusion matrix
- Classification report

7.2 Model Comparison
- Compare all traditional models
- Select best performing model
- Document results with specific percentages

==============================================================================
PHASE 3: TRANSFORMER APPROACH (HUGGINGFACE)
==============================================================================

STEP 8: Transformer Data Preprocessing

8.1 Data Cleaning and Tokenization
- Clean text data (remove special characters, etc.)
- Use HuggingFace tokenizer for proper tokenization
- Handle maximum sequence length constraints

8.2 Data Encoding
- Convert tokens to numerical IDs using tokenizer vocabulary
- Create attention masks
- Prepare data in format expected by transformer models

STEP 9: Transformer Model Building

9.1 Model Selection
Choose from pre-trained models:
- BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
- RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Approach)
- DistilBERT (Lightweight BERT version)
- Others (justify your choice)

9.2 Baseline Evaluation
- Test pre-trained model WITHOUT fine-tuning
- Record baseline accuracy on your dataset

9.3 Model Fine-Tuning (BONUS)
- Fine-tune selected model on your dataset
- Configure parameters:
  * Batch size
  * Learning rate
  * Number of training epochs
  * Optimizer settings

STEP 10: Transformer Model Evaluation

10.1 Evaluation Metrics
- Calculate same metrics as traditional approach:
  * Accuracy
  * Precision, Recall, F1-score per class
  * Confusion matrix

10.2 Compare Results
- Base pre-trained model vs fine-tuned model
- Traditional ML vs Transformer approaches
- Document all results with specific percentages

==============================================================================
PHASE 4: BONUS FEATURES
==============================================================================

STEP 11: Generative AI Summary (BONUS)

11.1 Review Summarization
- Use GenerativeAI to summarize reviews by:
  * Review score (0-5 stars)
  * Product categories (select top-K if too many)

11.2 Category Analysis
- If too many categories, focus on top 10-50 most common
- Generate summaries for each score within each category

STEP 12: Dashboard Creation (BONUS)

12.1 Visualization Tool Selection
- Choose: Tableau, Plotly, Streamlit, or similar
- Create interactive and clickable dashboard

12.2 Dashboard Features
- Sentiment distribution by category
- Model performance comparisons
- Review summaries by rating
- Interactive filters and drill-downs

==============================================================================
PHASE 5: DOCUMENTATION & DELIVERABLES
==============================================================================

STEP 13: Results Documentation

13.1 Performance Results Template
For each model, document:
- Overall accuracy: X%
- Per-class metrics:
  * Class Positive: Precision=X%, Recall=X%, F1-score=X%
  * Class Negative: Precision=X%, Recall=X%, F1-score=X%
  * Class Neutral: Precision=X%, Recall=X%, F1-score=X%
- Confusion matrix (table and visualization)

13.2 Model Comparison
- Create comparison table of all approaches
- Highlight best performing model and why
- Discuss trade-offs (accuracy vs speed vs complexity)

STEP 14: Final Deliverables

14.1 Required Deliverables
- PDF report with approach, results, and analysis
- Reproducible source code (Jupyter notebooks or .py files)
- PowerPoint presentation

14.2 Bonus Deliverables
- Interactive dashboard
- Hosted web app for real-time predictions
- Model deployment documentation
